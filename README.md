Oppidum - Open source XML MVC framework for eXist-db
=======

Oppidum is an XML-oriented MVC framework written in XQuery / XSLT / Javascript. It allows to develop applications on top of the [eXist-db]([http://exist-db.org/) native XML database. It is designed to create custom content management solutions (CMS) involving lighweight XML authoring chains.

Oppidum is developped and maintained by St√©phane Sire at [Oppidoc](http://www.oppidoc.com).

How does it work ?
------------------

Oppidum takes a declarative approach to web application development :

1. all the application REST mappings are declared in a special `mapping.xml` file
2. each mapping entry define a rendering pipeline to render the page
3. the first pipeline step generates a model with an XQuery script
4. the second pipeline step generates a view with an XSLT transformation
5. the last pipeline step integrates the result of the previous step into a mesh
6. all the steps above can be optional and the mesh can trigger further actions

Besides the steps above, Oppidum provides support to skin applications (a skin is a set of CSS and JavaScript files), to implement access control rules with form-based identification and to manage a multi-phases development cycle (dev, test and prod).

Oppidum is designed to support the creation of reusable modules that can be aggregated together through the mapping mechanism to create complete web applications. Each module is a set of conventions (usually associated with XML vocabularies) and XQuery, XSLT, JavaScript, CSS files.

How to get documentation ?
--------------------------

The Oppidum documentation contained in the `docs` folder is also published on the [Oppidum site](http://ssire.github.com/oppidum/) thanks to the Git Hub project pages mechanism. This is still a work in progress.

You can also visit the [Oppidum wiki](https://github.com/ssire/oppidum/wiki) to get more documentation and to learn about the roadmap.

There is a [tutorial repository](https://github.com/ssire/tutorial) that contains a simple web application written with Oppidum to get started.

We have also setup an [oppidum-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/oppidum-dev) Google group to share assistance and discuss new features.

As a general introduction you can read the [XML London 2013 presentation of Oppidum](http://xmllondon.com/2013/presentations/sire/). 

How to test it ?
----------------

You need to install [eXist-db](http://exist-db.org/exist/download.xml) on your system first. 

Then create a project folder that will contain your oppidum applications directly inside the the `webapp` folder of your eXist installation. For instance you can call it `projects`. The next step is to clone Oppidum inside your projects folder. This should create an `oppidum` folder into your project folder. Then edit the `oppidum/scripts/install.xql` file to set your project path into the `$local:base` variable at line 19. Note that by defaut this is set to `/projets/oppidum` (note the project folder is named __projets__ in French, so if you do not want to change anything call your projects folder `projets`) :

    cd {eXist-Home}/webapp
    mkdir "your projects folder name"
    cd "your projects folder name"
    git clone https://github.com/ssire/oppidum.git
    # or git clone git://github.com/ssire/oppidum.git if you have setup ssh with your github account
    vim oppidum/scripts/install.xql 
    # edit line 19 to replace "projets" with "your projects folder name"

Then you need to start eXist-DB and to execute `./bootstrap.sh` (from the `oppidum/scripts` folder) to install a few oppidum files into the database, passing as first parameter the database admin password :

    cd {eXist-Home}/webapp
    cd "your projects folder name"/oppidum/scripts
    ./bootstrap.sh password
    
That's it ! You can now point your browser to `http:localhost:8080/exist/"your projects folder name"/oppidum` (assuming you didn't change eXist-DB default listening port).
    
For convenience Oppidum distribution contains a `script/start.sh` shell script that you can use to start eXist-db. You can use the `script/stop.sh` to stop it (edit the file to set your database password within it). Both script must be run from the `oppidum` folder location because they use relative urls to invoke eXist-DB shell commands to start/stop the database.

Note : if you are using the mapping simulator tool you also need to edit `oppidum/resources/lib/generator.js` line 29 to replace "projets" with "your projects folder name".

Compatiblity
----------------

Oppidum runs with eXist-DB 1.4.x and 2.x out of the box on computers running Linux and Apple OS X. We haven't tested it on windows computer yet, there should be some issues with path separator in the library code. For eXist-2.x you need to have a Java SDK version 1.7 or superior. We are actually doing efforts to improve integration with eXist-DB 2.x to release Oppidum as a XAR package in the future (and to remove the dependency to the project folder name in the installer).

How to get most benefits of it ?
----------------

Oppidum has been developped to take benefits of [AXEL]([https://github.com/ssire/axel) (Adaptable XML Editing Library). This is a JavaScript client-side library for generating document editors into web pages. It works by transforming XTiger XML document templates into editable documents. The templates are XHTML files enriched with instructions to control editing. It can be used together with the [AXEL-FORMS](https://github.com/ssire/axel-forms) extensions to create form-oriented user interfaces with dynamic constraints checking.

Some Oppidum modules are available in different editions to speed up application development (e.g. image or file upload, forms generator, etc.). You are encouraged to develop and share your own modules.

Editions
--------

Oppidum comes in three editions:

* Public Edition (PE)
* Academic Edition (AE)
* Enterprise Edition (EE)

The public edition is available to everyone free of charge and does not involve any support. This is the edition publicly available on GitHub in this repository.

The academic and the enterprise editions offer special support and development packages targeted at academic institutions or enterprises. Please [contact us](mailto:s.sire@oppidoc.fr?subject=Oppidum editions) for further inquiries.

Third-party software
-------

Oppidum is standalone software written in XQuery, XSLT and JavaScript. The current version is tailored to run inside eXist-db environment.

For convenience the repository includes the following pre-built libraries which are often used in web development :

* AXEL ([http://ssire.github.com/axel/](http://ssire.github.com/axel/))
* AXEL-FORMS ([http://ssire.github.com/axel-forms/](http://ssire.github.com/axel-forms/))
* 960 grid system ([http://960.gs/](http://960.gs/))
